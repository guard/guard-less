A guard extension that compiles `.less` files to `.css` files when changed.

* Compatible with Less ~> 2.3.
* Tested against Ruby 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, Rubinius & JRuby (1.9 mode only).

## Install

You will need to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) first.

Install the gem with:

```bash
gem install guard-less
```

Add an initial setup to your Guardfile with:

```bash
guard init less
```

Please note that you also have to install therubyracer (or therubyrhino when you are running JRuby).

## Usage

Please read [Guard usage doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

```ruby
less_options = {
  all_on_start: true,
  all_after_change: true,
  patterns: [/^.+\.less$/],
  output: 'public/stylesheets'
}

guard :less, less_options do
  less_options[:patterns].each { |pattern| watch(pattern) }
end
```

Please read [Guard doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more info about Guardfile DSL.

## Options

```ruby
all_after_change: [true|false]   # run on all files after any changed files
                                    # default: true

all_on_start: [true|false]       # run on all the files at startup
                                    # default: true

output: 'relative/path'          # base directory for output CSS files; if unset,
                                    # .css files are generated in the same directories
                                    # as their corresponding .less file
                                    # default: nil

import_paths: ['lib/styles']     # an array of additional load paths to pass to the
                                 # LESS parser, used when resolving `@import`
                                 # statements
                                 # default: [] (see below)

compress: true                   # minify output

yuicompress: true                # minify output using yui

patterns: []                     # array of patterns for matching watched/processed files
```

### Output option

By default, `.css` files will be generated in the same directories as their
corresponding `.less` files (partials beginning with `_` are always excluded).

To customize the output location, pass the `:output` option as described above,
and be sure to use a match group in the regular expression in your watch to
capture nested structure that will be preserved, i.e.

```ruby
less_options = {
  all_on_start: true,
  all_after_change: true,
  patterns: [/^app/stylesheets/(.+\.less)$/],
  output: 'public/stylesheets'
}

guard :less, less_options do
  less_options[:patterns].each { |pattern| watch(pattern) }
end
```

will result in `app/stylesheets/forums/main.less` producing CSS at
`public/stylesheets/forums/main.css`.

### Import paths option

As each `.less` file is parsed, the directory containing the file is
automatically prepended to the import paths, so imports relative to your watched
dirs like `@import 'shared/_type-styles'` should always work. You can supply
additional paths with this option so that, for the `['lib/styles']` example, a
file at `lib/styles/reset.less` could be imported without a qualified path as
`@import 'reset'`.
